== Deployment

=== Overview

The team implemented a Docker-based deployment approach that allows for both local development and production scenarios.

=== Deployment Architecture

The deployment of the architecture follows a containerized microservices pattern, where each component runs in its own Docker container. The application consists of the following services:

* *Frontend*: Vue.js web interface exposed to users
* *Authentication*: Handles user authentication and token generation
* *User Management*: Manages user profiles and preferences
* *Crypto Market*: Retrieves and processes cryptocurrency market data
* *Notification*: Manages and sends notifications to users
* *Event Dispatcher*: Coordinates events between different services
* *MongoDB*: Database server storing application data

=== Docker Compose Configuration

The team decided to maintain two separate Docker Compose configurations for different deployment scenarios:

==== Local Development Configuration

The local development configuration (`docker-composelocale.yml` link:https://github.com/CryptoMonitorASW-SPE/bootstrap/blob/main/docker-composelocale.yml[GitHub]) builds services directly from source code in local directories. This approach is designed for development purposes, allowing developers to test changes made to individual services without rebuilding images.

[source,yaml]
----
# Example from local configuration
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./src/vue-frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    # Configuration continues...
----

==== Production Deployment Configuration

The production configuration (`docker-compose.yml` link:https://github.com/CryptoMonitorASW-SPE/bootstrap/blob/main/docker-compose.yml[GitHub]) uses pre-built images from our GitHub Container Registry. This approach ensures consistent, tested deployments across environments.

[source,yaml]
----
# Example from production configuration
services:
  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/cryptomonitorasw-spe/vue-frontend:latest
    # Configuration continues...
----

=== Network Architecture

The deployment utilizes two distinct Docker networks:

* *Internal network* (`interna`): A bridge network with internal access only, used for service-to-service communication that should not be directly accessible from outside the Docker environment. This provides an additional layer of security by isolating internal services.

* *External network* (`esterna`): A bridge network that allows external access to services that need to be publicly available.

[source,yaml]
----
networks:
  interna:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.bridge.name: "br-interna89012"
      com.docker.network.enable_ipv6: "false"
  esterna:
    driver: bridge
    internal: false
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.bridge.name: "br-esterna89012"
      com.docker.network.enable_ipv6: "false"
----

=== Service Dependencies and Health Checks

The deployment implements dependency management to ensure services start in the correct order. For example, the frontend depends on the event-dispatcher, which depends on other services.

Each service includes health checks that verify its operational status before dependent services are started:

[source,yaml]
----
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 5s
----

This approach prevents cascading failures where dependent services start before their prerequisites are fully operational.

=== Environment Variables and Configuration

It has been used the Docker Compose's anchors and extensions feature to define reusable configuration blocks, making the configuration of the project DRY and easier to maintain:

[source,yaml]
----
# Base service definitions with anchors for individual services
x-service-defs:
  authentication-name: &auth-name authentication
  authentication-port: &auth-port 3000
  # More definitions...

# Service-specific environment variables
x-auth-env: &auth-env
  NAME: *auth-name
  PORT: *auth-port
  USER_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_NAME: *user-name
  USER_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_PORT: *user-port
  MONGODB_HOST: *mongodb-name
  MONGODB_PORT: *mongodb-port
----

These environment variables are then injected into each service:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  authentication:
    # Other configuration...
    environment:
      <<: *auth-env
      JWT_SIMMETRIC_KEY: ${JWT_SIMMETRIC_KEY}
----

Sensitive configuration values like `JWT_SIMMETRIC_KEY` and `COINGECKO_API_KEY` are provided through environment variables loaded from a `.env` file, which is not committed to version control for security reasons.

=== Deployment Workflow

==== Local Development Deployment

For local development, the process is:

1. Clone the bootstrap repository
2. Create a `src` directory within the cloned repository
3. Clone each service repository (frontend, authentication, user-management, etc.) into the src directory
4. Create a `.env` file with required secrets
5. Run `docker-compose -f docker-composelocale.yml up --build`

This builds all services from local source code, allowing developers to test changes immediately.

==== Production Deployment

For production, the workflow is:

1. Changes are pushed to the main branch
2. CI/CD pipeline builds and tests the code
3. Docker images are built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry
4. On the production server:
   * Clone/pull the repository
   * Create/update the `.env` file
   * Run `docker-compose up -d`

This pulls the pre-built images from the registry and deploys them according to the production configuration.


=== Monitoring

Each service exposes a `/health` endpoint that can be used for monitoring. In a production environment, these endpoints can be integrated with monitoring tools to provide alerts and visualization of system health.
