== Domain Driven Design
The first step in the development of the system has been to understand the domain in which the application will operate.
The Domain name identified is CryptoMonitor, composed of the two words Crypto, so Cryptocurrencies and
Monitor that stands for the verb Monitoring. So, the domain is about Monitoring Cryptocurrencies.

// [plantuml, {diagramsdir}/usecaseauth, svg]
// ----
// !include resources/puml/usecase/usecase-auth.puml
// ----

=== Ubiquitous Language
Once identified the domain name, the next step has been to define the Ubiquitous Language used by the team.
In this phase, the key concepts related to the domain under analysis are identified. Subsequently, a glossary of terms
and their definitions is created, establishing a shared language for all project stakeholders.

=== Event Storming
The knowledge crunching session was conducted using the Event Storming approach, that facilitates collaboration between developers
and domain experts to explore and define the project's domain. By utilizing color-coded sticky notes, the team iteratively identifies key elements,
including actors, domain events, commands and views/read models, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and requirements.
The steps followed during the Event Storming session are described as follows, until to the production of the context map.

==== _Step 1: Identify Domain Events_
Here are the domain events that can happen in the system identified during the Event Storming session:

image::../resources/png/domain-events.png[Domain Events]

==== _Step 2: Timeline_
The timeline is created to visualize the sequence of events and the flow of information in the system:

image::../resources/png/timeline.png[Timeline]

==== _Step 3: User Actions, External systems and Business Process_
The user actions (Commands, Actors, Read Model), external systems, and business processes are identified to understand the system's interactions:

- _UserInfoUpdatedEvent_: A user's profile information has been updated.

==== _Notification Context_

Manages and delivers user-defined alerts based on specific cryptocurrency events or conditions, such as price thresholds or percentage changes.
It handles the creation, activation, and triggering of alerts, and sends notifications, like push notifications. This ensures users stay informed about
important market movements relevant to their interests.

- _setPriceLimitCommand_: Set a price limit for a crypto.

*Domain Events:*

- _PriceAlertTriggeredEvent_: A price alert has been triggered for a crypto.
- _NotificationEnabledEvent_: A notification has been enabled for a crypto.

=== Context Map

At the end, after the identification of the Bounded Contexts, the team produced the Context Map that shows the relationships between the contexts.
Thanks to a careful analysis, the team decided to regroup the Watchlist, Wallet and User contexts under one Bounded Context called User Management Context.
This because the three contexts are strictly related to the user and his data.
Here is the Context Map:

**Customer-Supplier relationship between Bounded Contexts:**

1. Crypto Market Context → Notification Context

** The Notification Context (Customer) consumes data from the Crypto Market Context (Supplier).
** The Notification Context relies on price variations from the Crypto Market Context to trigger price alerts.

2. Crypto Market Context → User Management Context

** The User Management Context (Customer), specifically its Wallet and Watchlist subcontexts, depends on Crypto Market Context (Supplier) for market data.
** This data is necessary for tracking user investments (Wallet) and monitoring watched cryptocurrencies (Watchlist).

3. Authentication Context → User Management Context

** The User Management Context (Customer) relies on Authentication Context (Supplier) for user authentication and identity management.
** The User subcontext within User Management needs user credentials and authentication processes managed by Authentication Context.

4. User Management Context → Notification Context

** The Notification Context (Customer) depends on User Management Context (Supplier) for watchlist data.
** This allows Notification Context to trigger alerts based on user preferences and tracked assets.

**Conformist releationship between Bounded Contexts:**

1. Crypto Market Context ↔ User Management Context

** The User Management Context (Downstream) is a Conformist because it must adapt to the Crypto Market Context (Upstream).
** User Management has no control over how Crypto Market structures its market data and must consume it as provided.

2. User Management Context ↔ Notification Context

** The Notification Context (Downstream) is a Conformist because it must accept the User Management Context (Upstream) data model without modifications.
** Notification Context cannot influence how User Management structures watchlist data.

3. Authentication Context ↔ User Management Context

** The User Management Context (Downstream) is a Conformist because it must integrate with Authentication Context (Upstream) without altering its authentication model.
** User Management must comply with Authentication Context’s predefined user structures and authentication mechanisms.

4. Crypto Market Context ↔ Notification Context

** The Notification Context (Downstream) is a Conformist because it must consume price updates from Crypto Market Context (Upstream) without modifying how they are structured.
** Notification Context adapts to the market data format imposed by Crypto Market Context.
